This project works off of three arduinos,

One, on the quad, attatched to an NRF24 and gy-51 mpu6050 breakout,
One, in a controller w/ an NRF24 and some control input
And one, with an NRF24 just reading wireless serial output from the quad

The controller code is not in place yet, I am currently working on atti hold.

The atti hold code is quaternion based, meaning gymbal lock it not a thing, and in my opnion the math is very efficent/neat.

There are a few main sections of the code:

	- all of the initalization at the top of main()

	- At the top of the loop, the gyroscope values are being integrated (as a quaternion), and the accelerometer values are weighted in.

	- the target rates (qd, names will change aha) are calculated with quaternion derivatives

	- the quad PIDs to those rates

Feel free to use any or all of this code for your own benifit. Any links back to me are appreciated :+)
